```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

##Confidence Intervals

```{r}
otter_length <- c(38,41,50,27,32,41,48,60,43)

t.test(otter_length)
```
##T-tests (one sample t-test)

Suppose that a claim is made that the mean otter length is 50in.

```{r}
otter_test <- t.test(x=otter_length,mu=50)
otter_test
```
##Two sample t-test
```{r}
desert_bighorns <- c(32,44,18,26,50,33,42,20)
sierra_bighorns <- c(28,31,40,42,26,29,31)
t.test(x=desert_bighorns,y=sierra_bighorns)
```
